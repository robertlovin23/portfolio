CoreBarreFit is a landing page for an online Yoga business that allows users to sign up for classes and subscribe to e-mails. I used Wix to build this site, which I had not worked with before. However, it was fairly easy to get up to speed and build a good web design from scratch. This site will make it easier for their clients to sign up for classes and subscribe to their newsletters.
