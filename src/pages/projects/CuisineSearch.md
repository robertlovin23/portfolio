A React application that searches an array of restaurants and allows user's to filter these restaurants with either dropdown or search inputs. When you click on a restaurant in the paginated table, you are taken to a modal that explains more details about the restaurant, which then shows a map of it's location. This application was deployed with AWS Amplify.
